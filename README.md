### Description:
   The goal of this script is to be able to investigate/import multiple
   databases into one MySQL server by omitting data which is not required
   e.g. history, logging, debug tables.

   This script processes, reformats and reduces the MySQL database dump size
   for importing MySQL server. It lists the top 10 largest tables by counting
   the INSERT statements. E.g. some databases have huge tables which can be
   stripped out where required turning a 20GB SQL dump into a 150MB file
   By reducing this dump file size, multiple copies of the database take
   less time and space to import on a MySQL server.

   It also reformats hugely long INSERT lines so that each row is on a
   separate line making it easier for reading & grepping, and syntax is
   unaffected so it can still be imported into a MySQL server.

   This script removes the (6) from the TIMESTAMP column definition which
   specifies 6-digit precision. MySQL imports into servers with default
   installs, e.g. turnkey VMs, which tend to choke on the (6) format.

   This script was built and tested with Python v2.7. Free Python for
   Windows is available from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
   Linux will most likely already have it installed

### USAGE Examples:

#### To list large tables:
    ./ProcessSQL.py  Original.sql

#### To reformat INSERT statements into readable rows (good for grepping)
    ./ProcessSQL.py  Original.sql  Output.sql

#### To exclude INSERT statements for 3 tables: BigTable1 BigTable2 BigTable3
    ./ProcessSQL.py  Original.sql Output.sql  BigTable1 BigTable2 BigTable3


### KNOWN ISSUES:
   This will potentially split valid SQL data if it contains the un-escaped
   character sequence of "),(" since this is the INSERT row delimiter which
   is used to split the lines into readable SQL.

       Notes: Fixed some filenames vs file handles. Created backward
              compatible version ye olde Python 2.4.3

       Notes: Reworded help message to say 'tables to exclude' & added usage

     Version: v1.00.00
  Updated by: Tele
        Date: 2019-04-12
       Notes: Will overwrite an existing destination file with a warning but
              without asking. Code has no current known issues if args are
              observed correctly. Large SQL files obviously take longer, but
              we're not buffering the whole file to avoid consuming RAM.
              Added this header/documentation and some comments in code.

     Version: v0.01.00 beta
  Updated by: Tele
        Date: 2019-03-05
       Notes: Converted from Bash to Python for cross-compatibility with
              Windows, Linux, etc. Previously built on CygWin but not
              everyone has that installed. Python is easier to install
              and maintain on Windows. Script is easier to read.
